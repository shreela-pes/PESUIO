Tried one spin. Landed at some subpage of readersfavorite.com which was funny AF üòÇ

"Author Biography

Sheila Kell writes smokin‚Äô hot romance and intrigue. She secretly laughs when her mother, in that stern voice, calls it, ‚Äúnasty.‚Äù As a self-proclaimed caffeine addict nestled in north Mississippi with three cats, she wears her pajamas most of the day and writes about the romantic men who leave women‚Äôs hearts pounding with a happily ever after built on a memorable, adrenaline-pumping story."
